        <p>In the near future, the police department forces former blade runner 
            Rick Deckard (Ford) out of retirement to hunt four genetically 
            engineered humans who have escaped the colonies and returned to 
            Earth. Designed to do difficult, hazardous work, the manufactured 
            humans are stronger, faster and smarter than non-engineered 
            humans.

        <p>When Earth falls under attack from invincible aliens, no military 
            unit in the world is able to beat them. Maj. William Cage (Tom 
            Cruise), an officer who has never seen combat, is assigned to a 
            suicide mission. Killed within moments, Cage finds himself thrown 
            into a time loop, in which he relives the same brutal fight -- and 
            his death -- over and over again. However, Cage's fighting skills 
            improve with each encore, bringing him and a comrade (Emily Blunt) 
            ever closer to defeating the aliens.

        <p>Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives in a futuristic world in which 
            society is divided into five factions. As each person enters 
            adulthood, he or she must choose a faction and commit to it for 
            life. Tris chooses Dauntless -- those who pursue bravery above all 
            else. However, her initiation leads to the discovery that she is a 
            Divergent and will never be able to fit into just one faction. 
            Warned that she must conceal her status, Tris uncovers a looming war 
            which threatens everyone she loves.
