        <p>In the near future, the police department forces former blade runner 
            Rick Deckard (Ford) out of retirement to hunt four genetically 
            engineered humans who have escaped the colonies and returned to 
            Earth. Designed to do difficult, hazardous work, the manufactured 
            humans are stronger, faster and smarter than non-engineered 
            humans.
