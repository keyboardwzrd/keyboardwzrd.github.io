                <h1>Space Jam</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Space Jam is a 1996 American live-action/animated sports 
                    comedy film directed by Joe Pytka and written by Leo 
                    Benvenuti, Steve Rudnick, Timothy Harris, and Herschel 
                    Weingrod. The film stars basketball player Michael Jordan as 
                    a fictional version of himself; the live-action cast also 
                    includes Wayne Knight and Theresa Randle, as well as cameos 
                    by Bill Murray and several NBA players, while Billy West, 
                    Dee Bradley Baker, Kath Soucie and Danny DeVito headline the 
                    voice cast. The film follows Jordan as he is brought out of 
                    retirement by the Looney Tunes characters to help them win a 
                    basketball match against invading aliens intent on enslaving 
                    them as amusement park attractions.

                    Space Jam was the first film to be produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and was released theatrically in the United States on November 15, 1996, by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment label.[1] The film received mixed reviews from critics, who were divided over its premise of combining Jordan and his profession with the Looney Tunes characters, while the technical achievements of its intertwining of live-action and animation were praised.[5] It was a commercial success, grossing over $250 million worldwide to become the highest-grossing basketball film of all time until 2022, as well the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1996.

                    A standalone sequel, Space Jam: A New Legacy, was released in 2021, with LeBron James in the lead role. The sequel was met with negative reviews and failed to match the commercial success of the first film.

                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1973, a young Michael Jordan tells his father, James, 
                    about his dreams of playing in the NBA. Twenty years later, 
                    following James’ death, Jordan retires from basketball to 
                    pursue a career in baseball.

                    In outer space, the amusement park Moron Mountain is in 
                    decline. The proprietor, Mr. Swackhammer, learns of the 
                    Looney Tunes from the Nerdlucks, his quintet of minions, and 
                    orders them to abduct the Tunes to serve as attractions. The 
                    Nerdlucks enter the Tunes' universe hidden in the center of 
                    the earth and hold them hostage before Bugs Bunny convinces 
                    them to allow the Tunes to defend themselves. Tunes 
                    challenge the Nerdlucks to a basketball game, noting the 
                    latter's small stature. After seeing a documentary about 
                    basketball, the Nerdlucks infiltrate various NBA games, 
                    stealing the talents of Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, 
                    Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues. They use 
                    these talents to transform into gigantic, muscular versions 
                    of themselves known as the "Monstars".
                    
                    Realizing they need help, the Looney Tunes pull Jordan into 
                    their universe as he golfs with Bill Murray, Larry Bird, and 
                    Jordan's assistant, Stan Podolak. Bugs explains their 
                    situation to Jordan, who is initially reluctant to help. 
                    However, Jordan agrees after a confrontation with the 
                    Monstars, and forms the "Tune Squad” with the Tunes; they 
                    are joined by Lola Bunny, with whom Bugs is enamored. Jordan 
                    is initially unprepared, and sends Bugs and Daffy Duck to 
                    his house to obtain his basketball gear. Jordan's children 
                    aid them and agree to keep the game a secret, while Stan, 
                    searching for Jordan, notices Bugs and Daffy, follows them 
                    to their world, and joins the team. Meanwhile, the 
                    incapacity of the five players results in a national panic 
                    that culminates in the season's suspension. The players try 
                    to restore their skills through various methods, with no 
                    success.
                    
                    The game between the Tune Squad and the Monstars commences, with Swackhammer arriving to observe. The Monstars dominate the first half, lowering the Tune Squad's morale. During halftime, Stan surreptitiously learns how the Monstars obtained their talent and informs the Tune Squad. Disguising a bottle of water as "secret stuff", Bugs and Jordan motivate the Tune Squad, who improve in the second half using their cartoon physics. During a time-out, Jordan raises the stakes with Swackhammer: if the Tune Squad wins, the Monstars must relinquish their stolen talent, and if the Monstars win, Jordan will become a new Moron Mountain attraction. On Swackhammer's orders, the Monstars become increasingly violent, injuring most of the Tune Squad.
                    
                    With ten seconds left in the game, the Tune Squad is down by one point and one player, with only Jordan, Bugs, Lola, and Daffy still able to play. Murray unexpectedly arrives and joins the team. In the final seconds, Jordan gains the ball with Murray's assistance but is pulled back by the Monstars. On Bugs' advice, Jordan uses cartoon physics to extend his arm and achieve a slam dunk, winning the match with a buzzer beater. After Swackhammer scolds the Monstars for their failure, Jordan helps them realize that they only served him because they were once smaller. They insert Swackhammer inside a missile that sends him to the moon. After relinquishing their stolen talent, the Nerdlucks decide to join the Tunes. Jordan and Stan return to Earth and return the talent to the five players, whose remarks convince Jordan to return to the NBA
