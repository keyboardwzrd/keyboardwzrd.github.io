        <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p>
            Graphic design is a profession,[2] academic discipline[3][4][5] and 
            applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives.[6] Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of design[1] and of the fine arts. Its 
            practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using 
            manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics 
            to communicate visually.

            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is 
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the 
            compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery 
            to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone 
            expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a 
            demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally 
            or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic 
            message into a graphic manifestation.[7]
            <br>
            <br>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, 
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be 
            applied in the aviation world[8] or space exploration.[9][10] In 
            this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only 
            associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is 
            incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge 
            range of types and classes where it can be applied.
            <br>
            <br>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design 
            as applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing 
            in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in 
            the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct 
            profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 
            19th century[12] and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 
            20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information 
            exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than 
            ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies 
            and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence 
            of the engineers who develop them.[13]

            <p>William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the 
                term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it appears 
                in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, 
                a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an 
                article about technical education for printers:[15]
                <br>
                <br>
                An Enterprising Trades Union
                … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails 
                among printers is an assurance that with the elemental 
                principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow 
                in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and 
                decorating. …
                <br>
                <br>
                A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California 
                School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic 
                Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design 
                and Lettering. Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.[16]

            <h2 id="history">History</h2>
            <p>In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent 
                explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st 
                centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic 
                design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, 
                theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the 
                same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate 
                objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, 
                "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, 
                expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human 
                experience."[17]
                <br>
                <br>
                The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively 
                recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. 
                Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic 
                design emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. Others 
                understand that it began to be identified as such by the late 
                19th century.[11]
                <br>
                <br>
                It can be argued that graphic communications with specific 
                purposes have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and 
                the birth of written language in the third millennium BCE. 
                However, the differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, 
                and required training are such that it is not possible to 
                clearly identify the current graphic designer with prehistoric 
                man, the 15th-century xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.
                <br>
                <br>
                The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any 
                graphic manifestation as a product of graphic design, while 
                others only recognize those that arise as a result of the 
                application of an industrial production model—visual 
                manifestations that have been "projected" to address various 
                needs: productive, symbolic, ergonomic, contextual, among 
                others.
                <br>
                <br>
                Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
                profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
                social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.[18] 
                Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout 
                history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to 
                manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing 
                and book production developed in the 15th century, advances in 
                graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries, with 
                composers or typographers often designing pages according to 
                established type.[11]
                <br>
                <br>
                By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
                profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
                specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
                technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
                Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the 
                separation of the design of a communication medium (such as a 
                poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, throughout 
                the 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, book 
                publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all 
                visual elements of communication and integrated them into a 
                harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the 
                content. In 1922, typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the 
                term graphic design to identify the emerging field.[11]
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to 
                designers continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and 
                commercial possibilities of design. The profession expanded 
                greatly, and graphic designers created, among other things, 
                magazine pages, book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, 
                packaging, brands, signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV 
                programs and movies, and websites. By the early 21st century, 
                graphic design had become a global profession as advanced 
                technology and industry spread worldwide.[11]
            <h4 id="historical-background">Historical Background</h4>
            <p>In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut 
                to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A 
                Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed 
                book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and 
                books were produced using movable type printing, making books 
                widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).[19]

                In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg 
                developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace 
                using movable type made with a new metal alloy[20] that created 
                a revolution in the dissemination of information.[21]
            <h4 id="nineteenth-century">Nineteenth Century</h4>
            <p>In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design 
                education in Great Britain, informing the government of the 
                importance of design in his Journal of Design and Manufactures. 
                He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern 
                industrial technology and Victorian design.

                From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader 
                in graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, 
                creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era 
                style,[22] in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.[23] 
                Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, 
                directly influenced Art Nouveau.[24]

                Will H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in 
                the late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in 
                various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs 
                as promotions for a literary magazine titled The Chap-Book.[25]
