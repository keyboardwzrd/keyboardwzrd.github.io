            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,
            <sup>[1]</sup><i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a feature observed in 
            some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do 
            not touch each other, instead forming a canopy with channel-like 
            gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> 
            This is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also 
            occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> 
            There exist many 
            hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating 
            insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

        <h3>Possible physiological explanations</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> 
            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup> 
            It has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.
            <sup>[9]</sup> 
            The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest 
            that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an 
            example of convergent evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds. The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. 
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced 
            by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup>
             If the 
            crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they 
            gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains 
            instances of crown 
            shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this 
            idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive 
            to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, 
            and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited 
            in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> According to this theory, 
            variable 
            flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of 
            crown shyness.

            Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth 
            nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with 
            lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the 
            crown shyness patterns in eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the 
            trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in 
            canopy gaps.<sup>[13]</sup> Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the 
            branches of 
            <i>Picea sitchensis</i> (Sitka spruce) and <i>Larix kaempferi</i> 
            (Japanese larch) 
            suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading 
            shoots.<sup>[14][15]</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual 
            light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated shade 
            avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of 
            plant species.<sup>[16]</sup> Neighbor detection is thought to be a 
            function of 
            several unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the proximity of 
            neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a task widely 
            thought to be accomplished by the activity of the phytochrome 
            photoreceptors.<sup>[17]</sup> Many species of plant respond to an increase in 
            far-red light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by 
            directing growth away from the far-red stimulus and by increasing 
            the rate of elongation.<sup>[18]</sup> Similarly, plants use blue 
            light to 
            induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the 
            recognition of neighboring plants,<sup>[19]</sup>though this was 
            just starting 
            to be recognised in 1988.<sup>[20]</sup>

            The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown 
            shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on 
            well-understood shade avoidance responses.<sup>[6][21]</sup> 
            Malaysian scholar 
            Francis S.P. Ng, who studied <i>Dryobalanops aromatica</i>, 
            suggested that 
            the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing 
            when nearing the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.
            <sup>[6][21]</sup>

            A 2015 study has suggested that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> shows 
            different 
            leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and unrelated 
            conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This 
            response was shown to be contingent on the proper functioning of 
            multiple photosensory modalities.<sup>[22]</sup> A 1998 study 
            proposed similar 
            systems of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of growth as 
            explanations of crown shyness,<sup>[6][21]</sup> though a causal 
            link between 
            photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be experimentally 
            proven. This might explain instances of intercrown spacing that 
            are only exhibited between conspecifics.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
